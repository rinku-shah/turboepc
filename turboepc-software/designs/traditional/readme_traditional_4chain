1. Traditional EPC
    This is a 1 chain experiment with DGW, SGW and PGW connected to root ONOS controller
    RUN steps:
    1. on the base machine, create all bridges using the ~/bridge_init.sh script
    2. start the containers using the container start script
    3. ssh into all the containers on terminator using 10.0.3.* IPs (deafult username:ubuntu passworsd:ubuntu)
    4. on the root container :
        a. cd ~/onos 
        b. ./run_onos.sh
    5. To connect the individual switches to root, follow thses steps:
        a. cd ~/scripts
        b. ./run_switch_wo_log.sh // this will start the bmv2 switches
    6. once all the switches are started, we need to connect them to root controller in specific order 
       to connect to root controller go to terminal of each switch and run the following commands
        a. cd ~/scripts
        b. python con.py  // this will connect the switch to the root controller  
       Repeat steps 6a and 6b for all the switches in this order: DGW,SGW,PGW
    7. once all the switches are connected to root contoller, bring up the onos CLI and activate epc app at the root controller terminal using the steps below:
       a. cd ~
       b. onos localhost
       c. onos cli> app activate org.onosproject.p4tutorial.epc
    8. To start the ran Load Generator go to ran container terminal 
       a. cd ran_code/clone_bitwise_lg
       b. make
       c. sudo ./ran 1 1 0k // this will run ran for 1 thread for 1 minute
